                  <h3>The Filter</h3>
                  <p>1) Remove the bottom of a bottle</p>
                  <p>2) Turn the bottle upsidedown (with the cap down down)</p>
                  <p>3) Put the follwing materials in the bottle.
                    <li>pebbles</li>
                    <li>sand</li>
                    <li>a piece of cloth or bandages</li>
                    <li>charcoal</li>
                    <li>a piece of cloth or bandages</li>
                    <li>sand</li>
                    <li>pebbles</li>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cloth or bandages are used to ensure that all the different materials do not mix.</p>
                  <p>The pebbles and sand filter the particules and the dirt out of the water. </p>
                  <p>This filter will not remove any viruses and bacteria from the water so you have to boil the water after it is filtered.</p>

                <h3>How to use your filter</h3>
                <p>Pour the water from the pool or pond in top of your water filter, catch the water at the bottom of the filter in a clean cup.</p>
                <p>It is best to throw away the first bit of water that comes out of your filter it often is cloudy and not that clean.</p>
                <p>If the water that comes out of your filter is clear it is good and you can use it.</p>
                <p>Boil the water at least 1 minute before drinking it, cooking will kill bacteria and viruses that are still present in your water.</p>
